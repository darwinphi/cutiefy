        Britains police watchdog says the London force needs to address
        “disgraceful” behavior after an investigation found widespread bullying,
        discrimination and sexual harassment. To find the faithful, preachers in
        some areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo hold church where the
        crowds are, on boats traveling the countrys water highway. Among the
        infected are two workers who were helping to distribute aid shipments at
        the Tongan wharf after a volcanic eruption and tsunami tested positive.
        The United States and its allies have trained and helped equip the
        Ukrainian army. But it has little resemblance to the kind of
        sophisticated, contemporary military that distinguishes NATO members.
        The Russian president seemed to be trying to ratchet down tensions in
        the standoff over Ukraine, while claiming the United States was seeking
        to goad Moscow into an invasion. China is expanding its ties to Middle
        Eastern states with vast infrastructure investments and cooperation on
        technology and security.
